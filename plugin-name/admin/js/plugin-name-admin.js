	 * This enables you to define handlers, for when the DOM is ready:
	 *
	 * document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
	 *   // Your code here
	 * });
	 *
	 * When the window is loaded:
	 *
	 * window.addEventListener('load', function() {
	 *   // Your code here
	 * });
	 *
	 * ...and/or other possibilities.
	 *
	 * Ideally, it is not considered best practice to attach more than a
	 * single DOM-ready or window-load handler for a particular page.
	 * Although scripts in the WordPress core, Plugins and Themes may be
	 * practicing this, we should strive to set a better example in our own work.
